Textbook: _A Friendly Introduction to Software Testing_ by Bill Laboon
* PDF https://github.com/laboon/software-testing/blob/master/software-testing-laboon-ebook.pdf
* Hardcopy http://www.amazon.com/Friendly-Introduction-Software-Testing/dp/1523477377/

This course is designed to give the student a broad understanding of modern software testing and quality assurance. Topics covered will include: manual and automated testing, test driven and behavior driven development, performance testing, security testing, and testing strategy. Entire courses could be dedicated to any one of these topics. My goal is to introduce each topic and provide practical skills that are used in the industry.

## Grading (WIP)

Since the goal of this class is to provide practical skills, most of your grade will be composed of projects to be completed by one or two people.

Grading:
* Deliverable 1 (Manual test planning)
* Deliverable 2 (Unit testing / TDD)
* Deliverable 3 (System testing)
* Deliverable 4 (Performance testing)
* Deliverable 5 (TBD)
* Deliverable 6 (Test strategy)
* Class exercises

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group project, but are more than welcome to collaborate and ask questions with other groups, the Internet, or other colleagues.  However, any student caught collaborating or cheating in an unauthorized way will get an automatic 0 for that assignment, and may be penalized more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.  Examples of unauthorized collaboration include: wholesale copying and pasting of large sections of code, asking somebody else to do the assignment for you, or paying somebody to do the assignment for you.  If you question whether what you are doing is authorized, you may feel free to come speak with me during office hours or email me.

Assignments should be committed and pushed to GitHub by the beginning of class on the due date.  Write-ups are due at the beginning of class. Late assignments will not be accepted.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies in grading.  I will hand back papers and put the grades on CourseWeb in a reasonable amount of time.

****

Attendance for normal lectures is not required, but is STRONGLY recommended.  The instructor will try to ensure that all information will be available via slides or the textbook, but simply reading them may be insufficient to understand the concepts thoroughly.

Presence for group exercise days is required in order to get the full class participation score.

## Programming Language Selection

The class will use Java with the appropriate frameworks and tools (e.g., JUnit, Mockito, Selenium, VisualVM, Findbugs).  For the final project, students will write a paper on developing a testing process for a system under test, using the knowledge gained from other projects.  The students will then present a short talk summarizing their paper for the class.
